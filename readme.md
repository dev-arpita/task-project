## Task Project

- In this task, I have created 2 implementations for the given design mockup

### Implementation 1: HTML5 & CSS3 & Responsive Design

- Files used:

```
- index.html
- normalize.min.css (for browser compatibility issues like box model etc.)
- index.css
- index.js
```

- Implemented the menu with the javascript responsive menu functionality

### Implementation 2: HTML5 & Tailwind CSS

- tailwind.html
- Have used the cdn version for the prototype
- The same javascript responsive menu functionality can be developed as per the frontend framework to be used with tailwind components e.g: react, next.js etc.
